    "# Abstract \n",
    "Mental health patients struggle with financial, psychological, and logistical burden when seeking professional help. As such, social media, particularly Reddit, has become a popular place of outlet for them. In order to help mental healthcare become accessible and affordable at home, we aim to use supervised machine learning to detect self-harming and destructive behavior as well as classify potential mental disorders using the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) Diagnostic Criteria. Our model could also be utilized in a professional environment by assisting care providers with diagnosic confirmation. Additionally, the practicality of this experiment would extend into the implementation of notification alerts to reddit users privately, if their posts are detected to have a potential for self-harm or a diagnosis of a mental disorder.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the Reddit Mental Health Dataset, which consists of posts from 28 different subreddits (15 mental health support groups) from 2018-2020. In our methods, we deploy a Multi-Class Text Classification model in a cross-examination study to evaluate the performance difference with K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines to find patterns in people seeking support in mental health related subreddits. The posts will thus be related to mental disorders and harmful beahvior in order to potentially diagnose (or at least warn) users about the content of their posts, and then direct them to helpful resources in an accessible, private, and preventative manner.\n"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The current mental healthcare system places various financial, psychological, and logistical burden on those seeking professional help for their mental disorders. \n",
    "\n",
    "To list a few:\n",
    "- There is a huge shortage of therapists/psychiatrists, leading to months and even year-long waitlists for an incoming patient’s first appointment. Especially since many do not accept insurance, this causes a huge difficulty on patients finding connection to clinicians in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a strong social stigma against seeking professional help for mental disorders. That is, the fear of admitting to one’s issues and becoming labeled as “disabled” leads to anosognosia, or the denial or “lack of insight” in acknowledging one’s mental health issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is also the burden on incoming patients to find the best-fitting therapist in terms of location, specialization, cost, gender, age, and culture. When switching clinicians, the psychological burden of repeated intake sessions where one must elaborate on their mental health history can also be extremely cumbersome.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of this lack of outlet for mental health struggles, many turn to the internet to anonymously confess their difficulties and build communities for support. For example, Reddit has user-established mental health support groups for various mental health disorders such as addiction, alcoholism, Bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n",
    "Meanwhile, Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) is the field that explores computer and robot technology that focuses on the relationship between people and machines. As closely related to humans, HMI has focused on enhancing human health, particular mental health. \n",
    "For example, Chikersal et al. developed a automatic Depression detection through machine learning of biosensor feedbacks [2].\n",
    "There are also various products in the market that use machine learning and other intelligent methods for user personalization in preference and treatment. For example, there are mobile apps including mindfulness apps like Headspace, Calm, and UCLA Mindful and therapeutic robots like Paro, Hugvie, Pepper, Carebot, and QTRobot [4, 5].\n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we want to tackle the problem of lack of accessible, affordable, and preventative mental health support resources through the use of popular social media sites. Specifically, we want to assist Internet users struggling with mental disorders who have exhibited a range of qualifying behavior traits, as per DSM-5, through the use of an automated system that classifies them based on their Reddit posts. The system would learn words or phrases commonly used by people with the qualifying criteria versus people who do not exhibit any concern within the same Reddit thread, with the use of KNN and SVM text classification models. That is, the system would learn words and phrases used by people who clearly exhibit behavior and meet the criteria for mental disorders vs. those who do not struggle with mental disorders at all in order to create subcategories of potential disoders. Then, given a reddit post, the system will try to detect whether the post meets concerning criteria, at which point the user will be notified and directed to relevant resouces.\n"

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we plan to use is text that was scraped from Reddit’s mental health support subreddits. The link to the dataset can be found in as item 3 in the footnotes [3]. The data was originally created to examine the effects of COVID-19 on mental health. It contains posts from 28 different subreddits, or 15 mental health support groups, and dates range from 2018-2020. The link provided includes a variety of categories relating to mental health support. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our project in particular, we will be analyzing the posts associated with self-harming behavior as per DSM-5 criteria. As a result, the data we will be examining are for example, in the case of \"Major depressive disorder\", would be\n",
    "\n",
    "- depression_2018_features_tfidf_256.csv\n",
    "- depression_2019_features_tfidf_256.csv\n",
    "- etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding these two datasets in particular, the each have about 24500 and 33500 observations, respectively. They also have a wide array of variables concerning the text and the text’s metadata. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the subreddit the text was scraped from\n",
    "- the username of the poster\n",
    "- actual text itself\n",
    "- date posted\n",
    "- unique words\n",
    "- syllables \n",
    "\n",
    "In total there are 350 variables for one observation. Similarly, a single observation basically constitutes a post on the subreddit would have all of the aforementioned variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our project revolves around textual analysis and classification, we will predominantly focus on the reddit post's text portion of each observation. As a result, some critical variables are:\n",
    "- the text of the post\n",
    "- the date it was posted\n",
    "- number of words\n",
    "- number of times a “trigger” word such as gun or suicide is used, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The text of the post will be in string format and the date will also be a string in MM/DD/YYYY format. Other variables will be in integer or float format as they are primarily responsible for keeping track of word frequencies. Because we are only using a few of the variables out of the 350 available, we will need to remove the unnecessary ones. Additionally, to preserve anonymity, we will be removing the author variable from each observation. Some additional cleaning could also take the form of removing special characters from text of each observation or making all characters lowercase. \n"
